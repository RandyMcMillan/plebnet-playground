Bitcoind is not using tor, simply because it takes much longer to sync the chain, and while testing this slows me down. The playground signet chain is only around 1MB at time of writing, and takes my machine ~15 seconds to be fully synced clearnet, via tor it is taking minutes. You will need to setup LND wallet from scratch, instructions below PM @xenonfun on Telegram to get access to the Plebnet Playground Telegram group All ports are completely exposed to local host, this is mostly to make it easy for end-users to tinker, and as the signet coins in the playground are worthless so there is little risk of hacking. You can modify the docker-compose.yaml should these cause conflicts. For Windows users you will need to use something like git bash until we make some powershell scripts to provide cleaner functionality Basic Setup Clone Repo & Install Requirements If you already have virtualenv installed, great.

If you do change your password make sure to update the unlock.password file with your new password. Make your first peer with the seed node for Plebnet Playground Signet connect-playground Now you should get some gossip about the network and be able to run something like this lncli describegraph | jq .nodes[] | grep \"alias\" and see a list of the various node aliases on the network FYI, your alias is not set in default configuration to avoid confusion, go ahead and edit your lnd.conf and make an alias=YourNewAliasName parameter and restart the container.

RTL Setup RTL will at http://localhost:3000 , the default password is password and it will ask you to change this on first login. ThunderHub Setup ThunderHub will at at http://localhost:3001 , the default password is password . You can change that by editing the volumes/thub_datadir/thubConfig.yaml . Change masterPassword: thunderhub-$2a$12$oRzmFZSOmvYv1heHkU053uv0a1tX9MXNqmcMpZs2hQ0t8k1Onnk1a to masterPassword: mynewpassword . Then restart thunderhub using alias restart-thub .

How to setup Balance of Satoshis (BOS) You may install bos only after you have generated an lnd wallet with create-lnd-wallet . sudo python3 ./install_bos.py If you created the bos alias above, you should be good to go bos --version 10.9.2 How to setup plebnet dashboard The interactive dashboard is an experimental visualization engine for viewing the lightning network. If you used the docker-compose up -d command above, then the dashboard will run on http://localhost:8050 By default only the playground nodes are visualized. However, you can also visualize real lightning network data by placing a describegraph.json file in the repo's dashboard/ directory, then restart the dashboard setting environment variable USE_TEST_DATA=TRUE : USE_TEST_DATA=TRUE docker-compose up dashboard Additional reference material Links Plebnet Wiki Bitcoin Wiki Lightning Wiki Plebnet Telegram Contributors Richard Safier Nan Liu Lamar Wilson @Exfrog @stflowstate John Doe @rafgxyz @asherp @RandyMcMillan @nitesh_btc","title":"Home"},{"location":"#plebnet-playground-sandbox-docker-package","text":"This package will setup a bitcoind, lnd, and tor daemon that will connect to the Plebnet Playground Sandbox (Signet) Chain.
